# This README file is for the 0x07. Networking basics #0 project

This project was the first of two introducing networking concepts. In this project, I learned about the OSI model, LAN and WAN networks, and TCP/UDP data transfer protocols.

## Project Tasks

```0. OSI model```

o   0-OSI_model: Text file answering the following questions:

o   What is the OSI model?

    a.  Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect

    b.  The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology.

    c.  The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology.

o   How is the OSI model organized?

    a.  Alphabetically

    b.  From the lowest to the highest level

    c.  Randomly

```1. Types of network```

o   1-types_of_network: Text file answering the following questions:

o   What type of network a computer in local is connected to?

    a.  Internet

    b.  WAN

    c.  LAN

o   What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?

    a.  Internet

    b.  WAN

    c.  LAN

o   What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?

    a.  Internet

    b.  WAN

    c.  LAN

```2. MAC and IP address```

o   2-MAC_and_IP_address: Text file answering the following questions:

o   What is a MAC address?

    a.   The name of a network interface

    b.  The unique identifier of a network interface

    c.  A network interface

o   What is an IP address?

    a.  Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses

    b.  The unique identifier of a network interface

    c.  Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks

```3. UDP and TCP```

o   3-UDP_and_TCP: Text file answering the following questions:

o   Which statement is correct for the TCP box:

    a.  It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely

    b.  It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in 

    c.  the process

o   Which statement is correct for the UDP box:

    a.  It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely

    b.  It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in 

    c.  the process

 o   Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:

    a.  Have you received boxes x, y, z?

    b.  May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?

```4. TCP and UDP ports```

    o   4-TCP_and_UDP_ports: Bash script that displays listening ports.

    o   That only shows listening sockets.

    o   That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

```5. Is the host on the network```

    o   5-is_the_host_on_the_network: Bash script that pings an IP address received as an argument 5 times.

    o   Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}.
