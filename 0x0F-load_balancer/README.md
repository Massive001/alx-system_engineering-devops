# This README file is for the 0x0F. Load balancer project
===================

## Project Tasks
-----

``` 0. Double the number of webservers```


In this first task you need to configure `web-02` to be identical to `web-01`. 

```1. Install your load balancer```

Install and configure HAproxy on your `lb-01` server.

```2. Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet```

Just as in task #0, we'd like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.
